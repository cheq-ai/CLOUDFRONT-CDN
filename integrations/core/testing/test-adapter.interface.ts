/**
 * Shared unit-test adapter pattern for CDN integration behavioral tests.
 *
 * ## The problem
 * Cloudflare, CloudFront and Akamai all implement the same RTI decision pipeline, but each
 * exposes a different request/response API surface. Without a shared layer every CDN would
 * need its own 40+ copy-pasted tests; a single behavior change would require fixes in three
 * places and could easily be missed.
 *
 * ## The solution — adapter pattern
 * Each CDN implements `TestAdapter`, which translates its native format into the common
 * `NormalizedResult` shape. `registerSharedBehaviorTests` then drives all CDNs through the
 * same 49 tests (3 only where `validChallengeSkipsRti` is true) without knowing any CDN-specific details.
 *
 * ## What is mocked vs real
 * CDN adapters mock the core service methods via `SharedMocks` (callRTI, shouldIgnore,
 * getAction, getActionStrategy, generateDefaultBlockPage) so tests control decisions
 * precisely. `parseCookies` and `buildRtiResultHeader` are intentionally left as real
 * implementations so tests verify actual output, not duplicated mock formulas.
 *
 * @see registerSharedBehaviorTests in ./shared-unit-tests.ts
 * @see IntegrationTestAdapter in ./integration-test-adapter.interface.ts for the richer
 *      variant used when the real RTIHelperService decision logic should run end-to-end.
